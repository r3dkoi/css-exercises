    <!--I just noticed they actually give the hints on which
    is a class or ID on the text lol -->

    <!--From my understanding, the IDs must be named a different
    thing to another id since they're special while classes can
    be same name?-->

    <!-- Learnt to group selectors so even though its same selector
     it can also be used to differentiate. E.g the odd-number will
     be applied to all the other odd-number classes, while the one
     with the "cooler" one is also affected but has an extra
     special styling that doesn't affect the other odd-number classes.-->

    <p class="odd-number">Number 1 - I'm a class!</p>

    <div id="number2">Number 2 - I'm one ID.</div>

    <p class="odd-number cooler">Number 3 - I'm a class, but cooler!</p>

    <div id="number4">Number 4 - I'm another ID.</div>

    <p class="odd-number">Number 5 - I'm a class!</p>
